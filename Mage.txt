Communications protocol for data transmission
	-TCP/IP
		-communication protocols used to interconnect network 
		devices on the internet. Can also be used as a private 
		network. The communication uses a Client which is the 
		user or machine and a Server.
	-UDP is more faster because it nonexistent of acknowledging 
		packet when streaming. TCP uses the windows size and 				RRT (round trip)
			TCP mechanism helps detecting error, duplicate
			packets, delayed packets. 
	-FTP
		-it used to transfer one or more files and can be carried by
		Client A and Server B. Server-to-server. FTP normally uses
		Port number 21 and usually requires username and 
		password. FTP can send data in plaintext but not sensitive
		information.

	-HTTP
		-Is a protocol designed to transfer information between 
		computers over world-wide-web. Information can be
		documents, file, image, video.	

	Interview Question:

	1.port number for HTML: 4438
	21 forFTP
	1200 for others

	2. IP address range for 10.10.0.1/6:
	10.10.0.0/16 — 00001010.00001010.00000000.00000000
   				Class A


	3. How many data centers has facebook have:
	 (9= Denmark, Ireland, and states) the truth is facebook doesn’t 			publicly tell where so It can’t be a 1000s nor single digits.

	4. Forum: stack overflow and cplusplus, GitHub and Gitlab. Sometimes Facebook has
		private group. 

	5. I use VMWare and VirtualBox.
	
	6. What do you do if you can’t finish the projects.?
